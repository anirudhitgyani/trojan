The company will hire and train the employee for weeks and months before they can become a billable resource. The requirement from the business units also dynamically change. So the skills that they are trained for may no longer be in demand.</p><p>On the other hand most students do not even know of the various career paths available for them within the IT domain. They could have an edge if they were equipped with practical Technical knowledge and better soft skills.</p></div>
